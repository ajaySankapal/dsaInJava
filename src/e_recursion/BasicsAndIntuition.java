		// condition?
		// -> how can i take a large problem and break it down in bunch of sub-problems?
		// Such that each invokation of my method get me little bit closer to the problem I trying to solve
		
		// to learn about recursion lets take an example of ATM analogy
		// to know the number of peoples ahead of you, you can do two things
		//come out of the queue and count the peoples
		// or you can just ask the person next to you how many peoples are ahead of his/her
		// then if the person next to you also dont know, he/she will ask the person next to his/her
